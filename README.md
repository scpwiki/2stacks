# 2stacks
Tools for backing up scp-wiki.net.

Please note this branch is considered **legacy** and support is not provided. A future library will provide platform-agnostic methods to create your own backups.

## Requirements
* [Selenium Standalone Server](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)
* Selenium Web Driver (`pip install selenium`)
* [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) installed to your PATH
* A Wikidot API key.

2stacks is built alongside [SCUTTLE](https://github.com/pxdnbluesoul/scuttle) and is built for that platform first, but
you can get an idea of what the API would need to look like if you want to integrate this into your own backend.
